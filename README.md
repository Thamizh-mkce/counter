# Enhanced Counter App

## Features
Custom Increment and Decrement Values: Users can input specific values to increase or decrease the counter.

Counter Boundaries: Set minimum and maximum limits to prevent the counter from exceeding desired thresholds.

History Tracking: The app maintains a history of all counter values after each update.
